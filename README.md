3. Work section with images linking to applications(these are just place holders for now).
4. Contact section with phone, email and links to GitHub and LinkedIn.
5. Footer

#### Summary:

This project taught me about using HTML and CSS.  Making the site responsive was particularly tough.
Further work will need to be done to improve my skills with CSS(including Flexbox).
